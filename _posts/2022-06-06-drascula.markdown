Recently I was packaging one of the [Retro freeware games][games], which are supported by [ScummVm project][scummvm]. It's called [Drascula The Vampire Strikes Back][drascula] and the story is some kind of strange mixture between `Dracula` and `Frankenstein`.

When testing the language support I noticed, that it has been originally developed by a company in Spain called `Alcachofa Soft S.L.`, so additional to English it also includes speech in Spanish. Subtitles are available in English, German , French, Italian and Spanish. Therefore I decided to try improving my Spanish language skills and began to play this Adventure. And although the game is from 1996 I enjoyed it a lot!

I figured out that if you press `SPACE` while a character is speaking, the sentence will be interrupted (apart from the voice part). And by pressing `SPACE` again the game continues. Which was rather useful for me to have more time for reading and understanding the subtitles.

You can find [drascula][drascula-pkg] and [scummvm][scummvm-pkg] packages in the [games repository][games-repo] of the [openSUSE Build Service][obs].

Installation instructions for openSUSE 15.3:

{% highlight shell %}
# if you don't have added the 'games' repository yet
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/  games
# will install 'scummvm' package and other dependancies automatically
zypper in drascula
{% endhighlight %}

Then just run the command `drascula`, select your language (via `xmessage`; isn't this retro?) and enjoy!

And in case you struggle - Walthroughs are available on Youtube - also in Spanish. :-)
